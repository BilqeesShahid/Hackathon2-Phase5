# Tasks: Todo In-Memory Python Console Application

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-todo-console-app/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), data-model.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Single project: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project structure per plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan in src/models/, src/services/, and src/
- [x] T002 Create empty __init__.py files in src/models/ and src/services/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T003 Create Task dataclass in src/models/task.py with id, title, description, and completed fields
- [x] T004 [P] Implement TaskService class in src/services/task_service.py with in-memory task storage
- [x] T005 [P] Implement ID counter and next_id generation in TaskService

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Add and View Tasks (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Users can add tasks and view all tasks

**Independent Test**: Run the application, add a task with `add "Test Task" "Description"`, then run `view` and verify task appears

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T006 [P] [US1] Implement create_task method in src/services/task_service.py (validates title, generates ID)
- [x] T007 [P] [US1] Implement get_all_tasks method in src/services/task_service.py (returns ordered list)
- [x] T008 [P] [US1] Implement get_task_by_id method in src/services/task_service.py
- [x] T009 [US1] Implement main loop and menu display in src/main.py (shows available commands)
- [x] T010 [US1] Implement add command handler in src/main.py (parses input, calls TaskService)
- [x] T011 [US1] Implement view command handler in src/main.py (displays all tasks or "No tasks to show")

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete - users can add and view tasks

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Update and Complete Tasks (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can update task details and toggle completion status

**Independent Test**: Create a task, update it with `update 1 "New Title" "New Description"`, then complete it with `complete 1`

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T012 [P] [US2] Implement update_task method in src/services/task_service.py
- [x] T013 [P] [US2] Implement toggle_complete method in src/services/task_service.py
- [x] T014 [US2] Implement update command handler in src/main.py (validates ID and input)
- [x] T015 [US2] Implement complete command handler in src/main.py (toggles status)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1 AND 2 complete - users can add, view, update, and complete tasks

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Delete Tasks (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users can delete tasks by ID

**Independent Test**: Create a task, delete it with `delete 1`, then run `view` and verify task is gone

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T016 [P] [US3] Implement delete_task method in src/services/task_service.py (returns bool)
- [x] T017 [US3] Implement delete command handler in src/main.py (validates ID, shows error if not found)

**Checkpoint**: User Stories 1, 2, AND 3 complete - all CRUD operations working

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Menu Navigation and Exit (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Users can navigate the menu and exit cleanly

**Independent Test**: Start the application, verify menu displays all commands, run `exit` and verify clean termination

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T018 [US4] Enhance main loop in src/main.py for robust input handling
- [x] T019 [US4] Implement exit command handler in src/main.py (clean termination)
- [x] T020 [US4] Add input validation and error messages for invalid menu selections

**Checkpoint**: All user stories complete - application fully functional

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that ensure all success criteria are met

- [x] T021 [P] Add comprehensive error handling for all edge cases from spec.md
- [x] T022 [P] Verify all success criteria:
  - [x] SC-001: Operations reflect immediately
  - [x] SC-002: Invalid inputs handled without crashing (95% target)
  - [x] SC-003: New user can add and view within 30 seconds
  - [x] SC-004: Menu displays within 1 second
  - [x] SC-005: All operations complete under 1 second
- [x] T023 Add helpful error messages for:
  - [x] Non-existent task IDs
  - [x] Non-numeric input where numbers expected
  - [x] Empty task titles
  - [x] Invalid menu selections

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Navigation/exit independent of CRUD

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before CLI handlers
- Core implementation before error handling
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create Task dataclass in src/models/task.py"
Task: "Implement create_task method in src/services/task_service.py"
Task: "Implement get_all_tasks method in src/services/task_service.py"
Task: "Implement get_task_by_id method in src/services/task_service.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test add and view independently
5. Demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Demo
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Demo
6. Polish → Final delivery

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Add and View)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Update and Complete)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Delete)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Task Summary

| Phase | Task Count | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Phase 1: Setup | 2 | Project structure |
| Phase 2: Foundational | 3 | Task model and service |
| Phase 3: US1 (P1) | 6 | Add and View |
| Phase 4: US2 (P2) | 4 | Update and Complete |
| Phase 5: US3 (P3) | 2 | Delete |
| Phase 6: US4 (P1) | 3 | Menu and Exit |
| Phase 7: Polish | 3 | Error handling and validation |
| **Total** | **23** | |

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 (User Story 1) - Add and View tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 8 tasks marked [P] across all phases

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
