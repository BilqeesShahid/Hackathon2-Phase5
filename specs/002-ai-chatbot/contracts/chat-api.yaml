        Send a chat message to the AI assistant for task management.
        The assistant understands natural language and performs CRUD operations on tasks.

        **Stateless Design**: All conversation history is loaded from database on each request.

        **Request Flow**:
        1. Validate JWT token
        2. Load conversation history (if conversation_id provided)
        3. Append user message to history
        4. Run OpenAI Agent (with subagents + skills)
        5. Execute MCP tool(s) as needed
        6. Store assistant response in database
        7. Return response to client
